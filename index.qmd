I am an Associate professor in Applied Mathematics at the [Faculty of Science](https://www.pmf.uns.ac.rs/en/), University of Novi Sad, Serbia, and a Senior Researcher in the [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning group](https://www.iit.it/it/computational-sciences) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genova, Italy.

My research focuses on computational mathematics, numerical linear algebra, statistics and machine learning, with a particular interest in stochastic processes and dynamical systems in general. Currently, I am working on developing novel computational methods that harness the power of ML and AI.
